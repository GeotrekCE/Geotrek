msgid ""
"In the late nineties, the IT industry was not confortable with the "
"confusion introduced by the word *Free* in English (\"free\" as freedom, "

"Source* instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../faq.rst:78
msgid ""
"Today, those copies of Open Source software can be obtained on the "
"Internet for free of course. But yet, the GNU Software Fundation `still "
"recommends to claim a financial contribution "
"<https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html>`_ when distributing "
"them, in order to support the development and maintenance. And note that "
"nowadays, many of the most important Open Source applications have their "
